## 1. Dataset Overview

### 1.1 Total Transactions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM transactions;
```

Insights: The dataset contains 6362620 total transactions.

### 1.2 Total Fraudulent Transactions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_fraud
FROM transactions
WHERE isFraud = 1;
```

Insights: There are 8213 fraudulent transactions.

### 1.3 Transactions per Type
```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM transactions
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

Insights: The most common transaction is "CASH_OUT" (2237500 records) followed by "PAYMENT" (2151495), "CASH_IN" (1399284), "TRANSFER" (532909) and "DEBIT" (41432).

### 1.4 Fraudulent Transactions per Type
```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS total_fraud
FROM transactions
WHERE isFraud = 1
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY total_fraud DESC;
```

Insights: The number of fraudulent CASH_OUT (4,116) and TRANSFER (4,097) transactions is very similar. This likely reflects the typical fraud pattern in the dataset, where funds are first transferred to a fraudulent account (TRANSFER) and then quickly cashed out (CASH_OUT), resulting in nearly equal counts for both steps of the scheme.

## 2. Descriptive Statistics
### 2.1 Amount Statistics (All Transactions)
```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(amount) AS min_amount,
    MAX(amount) AS max_amount,
    AVG(amount) AS avg_amount,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM transactions;
```

Insights: The transaction amounts range from a minimum of 0.0 to a maximum of 92,445,516.64 with an average of 179,861.90 per transaction. The total value of all transactions is 1,144,392,944,759.76.

### 2.2 Amount Statistics (Fraudulent Transactions)
```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(amount) AS min_amount,
    MAX(amount) AS max_amount,
    AVG(amount) AS avg_amount,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM transactions
WHERE isFraud = 1;

SELECT
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN isFraud = 1 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_fraud_amount,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN isFraud = 1 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) / SUM(amount), 4) AS fraud_amount_percentage
FROM transactions;
```

Insights: Fraudulent transactions have amounts ranging from 0.0 to 10,000,000.0, with an average value of 1,467,967.29 per transaction. The total value of all fraudulent transactions is 12,056,415,427.84, representing approximately 1.05% of the total transaction volume.

### 2.3 Fraud Rate by Transaction Type
```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS total,
    SUM(isFraud) AS fraud_count,
    ROUND(AVG(isFraud)*100,2) AS fraud_percentage
FROM transactions
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY fraud_percentage DESC;
```

Insights:
(Which types have the highest fraud rate?)

## 3. Balance Checks / Data Quality
### 3.1 Transactions with Zero Origin Balance but Non-Zero Amount
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_orig_balance
FROM transactions
WHERE oldBalanceOrig = 0 AND amount > 0;
```

Insights:
(Potential data anomaly: origin accounts starting with zero?)

### 3.2 Transactions with Zero Destination Balance but Non-Zero Amount
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_dest_balance
FROM transactions
WHERE oldBalanceDest = 0 AND amount > 0;
```

Insights:
(Potential data anomaly: destination accounts receiving money with zero balance?)

### 3.3 Fraudulent Transactions with Zero Destination Balance
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS fraud_zero_dest
FROM transactions
WHERE isFraud = 1 AND oldBalanceDest = 0 AND newBalanceDest = 0;
```

Insights:
(Does fraud happen when destination accounts start at zero?)

## 4. Account-Level Analysis
### 4.1 Total Transactions per Origin Account
```sql
SELECT nameOrig, COUNT(*) AS total_txn, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY nameOrig
ORDER BY total_txn DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Insights:
(Top origin accounts by number of transactions and total amount)

### 4.2 Total Fraudulent Transactions per Origin Account
```sql
SELECT nameOrig, COUNT(*) AS total_fraud, SUM(amount) AS total_fraud_amount
FROM transactions
WHERE isFraud = 1
GROUP BY nameOrig
ORDER BY total_fraud DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Insights:
(Which origin accounts have the most fraudulent transactions?)

### 4.3 Accounts Involved in Both TRANSFER and CASH_OUT Fraud
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t1.nameDest AS fraud_account
FROM transactions t1
JOIN transactions t2
  ON t1.nameDest = t2.nameOrig
WHERE t1.type = 'TRANSFER' AND t1.isFraud = 1
  AND t2.type = 'CASH_OUT' AND t2.isFraud = 1;
```

Insights:
(Accounts potentially involved in multi-step fraud schemes)

## 5. Time-Based Analysis
### 5.1 Fraudulent Transactions Over Time
```sql
SELECT step, COUNT(*) AS fraud_count
FROM transactions
WHERE isFraud = 1
GROUP BY step
ORDER BY step;
```

Insights:
(Are frauds evenly distributed over time or clustered?)

### 5.2 Total Transactions Over Time
```sql
SELECT step, COUNT(*) AS total_txn
FROM transactions
GROUP BY step
ORDER BY step;
```

Insights:
(Compare total activity vs. fraud activity over time)
